## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Add `.env` and `.env.production` environments with `VITE_ORIGIN` variables for local development and production (used by `npm run build`).

## Developing

Run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

Build production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command emits to the `build` directory.
